## MOM(04-07-19):-
- [X] request.form vs wtf_form.form
wtf_form.form handles form data itself for user where as request.form we have to explicitly do the things
lot of built in methods are there in wtf_form.form eg. succesfull validation, input validation etc.

need to check in which scenario one will be more beneficial.(both)
need to check in the code and have to fix db issue.(manish)
need to work on db part for making user entry.(Siddharth)
